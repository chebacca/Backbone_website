# Cursor Project Rules — Dashboard v14 Licensing Website

Project: Dashboard v14 Licensing Website (React + Vite frontend, Express + Prisma backend, Stripe payments, SendGrid emails)
Workspace: pnpm monorepo with `client`, `server`, `shared`

Core Ports:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3002
- Backend API: http://localhost:3003
- DB (Postgres): 5432 (via env/Docker)

Package Manager & Node:
- Use pnpm (>= 8). Do not use npm/yarn.
- Node >= 18.

Key Commands (run at repo root):
- Dev: `pnpm dev` (concurrently runs server and client)
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Start (prod): `pnpm start` (starts compiled server on 3003)
- DB (from root): `pnpm setup:db`, `pnpm db:reset`, `pnpm db:studio`
- Alt scripts: `./quick-start.sh`, `./launch.sh`, `./status.sh`

Environment (server/.env):
- PORT=3003, FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3002, CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3002
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../licensing_db
- JWT_SECRET, JWT_EXPIRES_IN, JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN
- Stripe: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_*_PRICE_ID
- SendGrid: SENDGRID_API_KEY, FROM_EMAIL, FROM_NAME

Environment (client .env):
- VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3003
- VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

Architecture:
- `client/`: React 18 + TS + Vite + MUI + React Query + Stripe.js
- `server/`: Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Stripe SDK + SendGrid + Zod + Helmet + CORS + Rate limiting
- `shared/`: shared TS types

Authoritative Docs:
- Always consult `mpc-library/` for architecture, flows, API contracts, compliance, payments, licensing, prompts, and runbooks.

Coding Standards:
- TypeScript everywhere; explicit types for exported APIs; avoid `any`.
- Follow Clean Code naming; functions are verbs; variables are meaningful nouns.
- Prefer early returns; shallow nesting; handle errors first.
- Never log secrets or raw tokens.
- Use centralized error helpers and consistent JSON responses.
- Validate inputs via `express-validator`/Zod; sanitize user inputs.
- Prisma: favor explicit selects; no raw SQL unless unavoidable.
- Don’t change ports or package manager in code.

Security & Compliance:
- Enforce JSON-only responses on API routes; never return HTML from API.
- Use JWT via `JwtUtil`; never expose full tokens in logs.
- Apply `helmet`, CORS, rate limiting on `/api/`.
- Webhooks: verify signatures (Stripe) and store events in `webhook_events`.
- Record consent and audit logs for key actions as per `UserAuditLog`, `PrivacyConsent`.
- Follow GDPR, KYC/AML flows described in `mpc-library/COMPLIANCE_SECURITY_MPC.md`.

API Surface (server/src/routes):
- Auth: register, login, refresh, verify-email, forgot/reset password, me, update profile, logout
- Payments: pricing, create-subscription, history, payment details, cancel, update payment method, calculate-tax, webhook
- Subscriptions: list, details, update, cancel, reactivate, invoices, usage, payment method, billing history, preview changes, renewal, add seats
- Licenses: my-licenses, activate, deactivate, validate, details, analytics, transfer, bulk create, sdk versions, report issue, usage, SDK downloads
- Users: billing address, tax info, business profile, KYC verify, consent, consent history, audit log, export data, request deletion, statistics, notifications
- Admin: dashboard stats, users, user details/update, subscriptions, licenses, revoke license, compliance events, resolve, analytics, reports, enterprise customers, system health
- Webhooks: stripe, sendgrid, test, health, retry-failed

Client API Usage:
- Use `client/src/services/api.ts` `api` instance, `endpoints` map, and `apiUtils` helpers.
- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to backend origin (default http://localhost:3003).
- Auth token stored in `localStorage` key `auth_token`.

Testing & Quality:
- Prefer lightweight unit tests (to be added) and integration via REST clients/Postman.
- Run `pnpm build` before shipping; ensure ESLint/TS passes in client and server.

Pull Request Review Checklist:
- API: typed inputs/outputs, validation, consistent error schema.
- Security: authentication/authorization enforced; no leakage of PII/secrets.
- Compliance: audit/consent/compliance events created where required.
- Performance: N+1 avoided; indices implied by query patterns.
- DX: clear naming, small functions, docs updated in `mpc-library/`.

Cursor Agent Guidance:
- Always read relevant doc in `mpc-library/` before edits.
- Prefer changes scoped to `client/`, `server/`, or `shared/` as needed.
- After server edits: run `pnpm build` and (if needed) `pnpm setup:db`.
- Do not introduce new frameworks or switch package manager.
- Maintain port mapping (3002 web, 3003 API) and Stripe/SendGrid flows.
