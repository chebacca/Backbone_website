# Cloud Projects Page - Create Project & Create Dataset Buttons Restored

## üéØ **Issue Resolved**
The Create Project and Create Dataset buttons on the Cloud Projects page have been restored and enhanced for account owners and team administrators in the licensing website.

## üîß **Root Cause Analysis**
The buttons were already implemented but the `canCreateProjects()` function had insufficient role detection logic. Users with valid permissions were not being recognized properly, causing the buttons to be hidden.

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied**

### **Enhanced Permission Detection**
```typescript
// üîß ENHANCED: More comprehensive role checking
const canCreateProjects = useCallback(() => {
    // 1. ENTERPRISE_ADMIN users can always create projects
    // 2. Account owners with active subscriptions can create projects
    // 3. Team members with ADMIN role can create projects
    // 4. Users with OWNER role can create projects
    // 5. SUPERADMIN users have full access
    // 6. Users with any subscription plan (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) can create
}, [completeUser, isTeamMember]);
```

### **Enhanced Button Visibility**
- **Create Project Button**: Enhanced styling with hover effects and better visual feedback
- **Create Dataset Button**: Improved styling with consistent design patterns
- **Warning Messages**: Clear indicators for users who cannot create projects
- **Console Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for debugging permissions

### **Improved User Experience**
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons now have hover animations and better styling
- **Clear Messaging**: Different messages for team members vs account owners
- **Responsive Design**: Buttons wrap properly on smaller screens
- **Accessibility**: Better contrast and visual indicators

## üéØ **Who Can Create Projects & Datasets**

### **‚úÖ Account Owners**
- Users with `ENTERPRISE_ADMIN` role
- Users with `SUPERADMIN` role
- Users with `OWNER` role
- Users with active subscriptions (BASIC, PRO, ENTERPRISE)
- Non-team members (account owners)

### **‚úÖ Team Administrators**
- Team members with `ADMIN` role
- Team members with `TEAM_ADMIN` role
- Team members with admin permissions in localStorage

### **‚ùå Regular Team Members**
- Team members without admin privileges
- Users without active subscriptions (with helpful messaging)

## üöÄ **Button Features**

### **Create Project Button**
```typescript
<Button
    variant="contained"
    startIcon={<AddIcon />}
    onClick={handleCreateProject}
    size="large"
    sx={{
        minWidth: '160px',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        boxShadow: 2,
        '&:hover': {
            boxShadow: 4,
            transform: 'translateY(-1px)'
        }
    }}
>
    Create Project
</Button>
```

### **Create Dataset Button**
```typescript
<Button
    variant="outlined"
    startIcon={<DatasetIcon />}
    onClick={handleCreateDataset}
    size="large"
    sx={{
        minWidth: '160px',
        borderColor: 'primary.main',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        borderWidth: 2
    }}
>
    Create Dataset
</Button>
```

## üîç **Enhanced Debugging**

### **Console Logging**
- `‚úÖ User is ENTERPRISE_ADMIN, can create projects`
- `‚úÖ User is account owner with active subscription, can create projects`
- `‚úÖ Team member has ADMIN role, can create projects`
- `‚ùå User cannot create projects - regular team member without admin privileges`

### **Permission Checks**
The system now checks multiple sources for user permissions:
1. **User Role**: Direct role from user object
2. **Member Role**: Team member specific role
3. **Subscription Status**: Active subscription validation
4. **localStorage**: Team member data fallback
5. **Organization Ownership**: Owner role detection
