   - Confirms Firebase Storage configuration
   - Verifies Firebase Functions deployment

2. **Authentication Flows**
   - Tests user login functionality
   - Validates user profile retrieval
   - Tests admin login functionality

3. **User Dashboard**
   - Verifies license retrieval
   - Checks subscription management
   - Tests organization access
   - Validates organization context

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Tests admin statistics retrieval
   - Validates user list access
   - Checks license list access
   - Verifies payment list access

5. **Team Member Functionality**
   - Tests team member creation
   - Validates team member updates
   - Checks team member deletion

6. **Project Management**
   - Tests project creation
   - Validates project details retrieval
   - Checks project updates
   - Verifies project deletion

7. **Data Consistency**
   - Validates user-license relationships
   - Checks organization-member consistency
   - Verifies project-team member relationships

8. **Firestore Rules**
   - Tests security rules enforcement
   - Validates authenticated access
   - Checks unauthenticated access restrictions

9. **Web-Only Mode**
   - Verifies hosting configuration
   - Validates API rewrite rules
   - Checks client-side web-only mode configuration

## Key Findings

1. **Authentication System**
   - The authentication system is robust and properly integrated with Firebase Auth
   - Team member authentication works correctly in web-only mode
   - Two-factor authentication is properly implemented

2. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Firestore rules provide appropriate security for all collections
   - Indexes are properly configured for efficient queries
   - Storage rules restrict access to authorized users

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Admin functionality is restricted to users with appropriate roles
   - Dashboard provides comprehensive overview of system health
   - User, license, and payment management work correctly

4. **User Dashboard**
   - Dashboard provides relevant information to users
   - License management is intuitive and functional
   - Project management works correctly

5. **Team Member Functionality**
   - Team member creation and management work correctly
   - Role and permission management is properly implemented
   - Project assignment functions as expected

## Recommendations

1. **Testing Improvements**
   - Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
   - Add more unit tests for critical components
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints

2. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Document Firebase security rules and their rationale
   - Create user guides for admin and regular users

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize Firestore queries for large datasets
   - Implement pagination for large data tables
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

4. **Security Enhancements**
