# Firebase Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved

The original Firebase deployment was failing with:
```
npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
```

This occurred because Firebase's build system was trying to run `npm install` on the root `package.json` which contains pnpm workspace references that npm doesn't understand.

## Solution

We've implemented a **local build + static deployment** strategy:

1. **Local Build**: All building happens locally using pnpm
2. **Static Assets**: Only the built assets are deployed to Firebase
3. **No Remote npm**: Firebase never tries to install dependencies

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites

1. Install Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Update your project ID in `.firebaserc`:
   ```json
   {
     "projects": {
       "default": "your-actual-firebase-project-id"
     }
   }
   ```

### Deploy

**Option 1: Use the deployment script (Recommended)**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual deployment**
```bash
# Build the project
pnpm build:client

# Prepare deployment assets
mkdir -p deploy
cp -r client/dist/* deploy/

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Configuration Files

### `firebase.json`
- Points to `deploy/` directory (built assets only)
- No predeploy hooks (building happens locally)
- SPA routing configuration

### `.firebaseignore`
- Excludes all source files and package files
- Only allows `deploy/`, `firebase.json`, and `.firebaserc`
- Prevents Firebase from seeing any npm/pnpm files

### `deploy.sh`
- Automated build and deployment script
- Cleans previous builds
- Builds client with pnpm
- Copies assets to deploy directory
- Deploys to Firebase

## Architecture

└── .firebaserc              # Firebase project config
```

## Benefits

1. **No npm conflicts**: Firebase never sees pnpm workspace references
2. **Fast deployment**: Only static assets are uploaded
3. **Reliable builds**: All building happens in your controlled environment
4. **Easy debugging**: Build issues are caught locally before deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails locally
- Ensure pnpm is installed: `npm install -g pnpm`
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be >=18)
- Clear cache: `pnpm store prune`

### Firebase deployment fails
- Check Firebase CLI: `firebase --version`
- Verify login: `firebase login`
- Check project ID in `.firebaserc`

### Assets not loading
- Verify `deploy/` directory contains built files
- Check Firebase hosting URL in console
- Ensure SPA routing is configured in `firebase.json`

## Production Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Set up Firebase environment variables for API endpoints
2. **Custom Domain**: Configure custom domain in Firebase console
3. **SSL**: Firebase provides automatic SSL certificates
4. **CDN**: Firebase hosting includes global CDN

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Configure your backend API endpoints
2. Set up Stripe webhook endpoints
3. Configure email service (SendGrid)
4. Set up monitoring and analytics
