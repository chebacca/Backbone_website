# License Management Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix issues with license management in the dashboard application, focusing on:
1. Automatic license release when removing team members
2. Unregistering emails from Firebase Auth
3. Fixing analytics component calculations in the licensing page
4. Filtering out unassigned licenses by default

## Changes Made

### 1. Team Member Removal Process
- Added automatic license release functionality when removing a team member
- Modified `handleConfirmDeleteMember` function in `TeamPage.tsx` to:
  - Query for licenses assigned to the team member's email
  - Unassign each license using `firestoreLicenseService.unassignLicense()`
  - Mark the team member as REMOVED in Firestore
  - Log information about the process for debugging

### 2. Firebase Auth User Management
- Created a server-side script `delete-firebase-auth-user.js` to:
  - Delete Firebase Auth users by email
  - Release any licenses assigned to them
  - Update team member status to REMOVED
  - Handle error cases gracefully
- Added logging for client-side Firebase Auth operations
- Note: Full Firebase Auth user deletion requires Admin SDK privileges

### 3. License Page Analytics
- Fixed analytics component calculations in `LicensesPage.tsx`
- Added a useEffect hook to ensure metrics update when license assignments change
- Enhanced MetricCard component with tooltips for better understanding
- Updated summary cards to display accurate information about:
  - Assigned licenses
  - Available licenses
  - Utilization rate
  - Total licenses

### 4. Build and Deploy Process
- Created a comprehensive build and deploy script (`build-and-deploy.sh`) that:
  - Checks for Firebase CLI and authentication
  - Installs dependencies
  - Builds the client application
  - Copies build files to the deploy directory
  - Deploys to Firebase hosting with web-only mode settings
  - Provides feedback throughout the process

## Testing
The following scenarios have been tested:
- Removing a team member with an assigned license
- Viewing the license page with assigned and unassigned licenses
- Creating a new team member and verifying license assignment
- Checking analytics calculations with various license states

## Future Improvements
- Implement a Firebase Cloud Function to handle user deletion for better security
- Add batch operations for more efficient license management
- Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Add more comprehensive logging for debugging
