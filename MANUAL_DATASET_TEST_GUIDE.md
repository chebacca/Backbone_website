3. Click the "Actions" dropdown ‚Üí "Create Dataset"
4. Fill in dataset details:
   - **Name**: "Corporate Video Test Dataset"
   - **Description**: "Test dataset for validating collection assignments"
   - **Storage Backend**: Firestore
   - **Visibility**: Organization
5. In the "Collection Assignment" step, select these collections:
   - **Core System**: `projects`, `teamMembers`
   - **Sessions & Workflows**: `sessions`, `sessionWorkflows`
   - **Media & Content**: `mediaFiles`, `reports`
   - **Timecards & Scheduling**: `timecard_entries`
6. Enable "Organization Scoped Data"
7. Click "Create Dataset"

**Expected Result**: 
- Dataset created successfully
- Collections properly assigned and visible in dataset details
- No conflict warnings (unless intentional overlaps exist)

### üéØ Test 2: Assign Dataset to Project

**Objective**: Assign the created dataset to the "Corporate Video - Incredible Cotton Shirt" project.

**Steps**:
1. In the Cloud Projects page, find "Corporate Video - Incredible Cotton Shirt"
2. Click the "‚ãÆ" menu ‚Üí "Details"
3. Scroll to "Assigned Datasets" section
4. Select the dataset you created from the dropdown
5. Click "Assign"

**Expected Result**:
- Dataset appears in the "Currently Assigned Datasets" list
- Collection assignment details are visible
- "Organization scoped for data isolation" indicator shows

---

### üéØ Test 3: Edit Dataset Collections

**Objective**: Modify collection assignments in an existing dataset.

**Steps**:
1. In the project details dialog, find your assigned dataset
2. Click the "Edit" button next to the dataset
3. In the Edit Dataset dialog, you should see:
   - **Categorized collections** organized by type
   - **Dashboard collections** (not licensing website collections)
   - **Visual selection interface** with categories and icons
4. Add/remove collections:
   - Add: `inventoryItems` from "Inventory & Equipment"
   - Remove: `reports` from "Media & Content"
5. Click "Save Changes"

**Expected Result**:
- Changes saved successfully
- Updated collection list reflects modifications
- Real-time conflict analysis shows any warnings

---

### üéØ Test 4: Test Data Isolation

**Objective**: Verify that data is properly isolated by organization.

**Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. In the project details, refresh the datasets
4. Look at the Firestore queries in the network tab
5. Verify all queries include `organizationId` filters

**Expected Result**:
- All Firestore queries include organization-based filtering
- No cross-organization data leakage
- Proper multi-tenant isolation

---

### üéØ Test 5: Dataset Insights and Conflict Detection

**Objective**: Test the global dataset analysis and conflict detection system.

**Steps**:
1. In the Cloud Projects page, click "Actions" ‚Üí "Dataset Insights"
2. Review the analysis dashboard:
   - **Total Datasets**: Should show organization count
   - **Collection Overlaps**: Any conflicts between datasets
   - **Health Score**: Overall organization score
   - **Recommendations**: Optimization suggestions
3. Create a conflicting dataset:
   - Create another dataset with overlapping collections
   - Check if conflicts are detected and reported

**Expected Result**:
- Comprehensive analysis of dataset organization
- Clear conflict detection and recommendations
- Health score reflects dataset organization quality

---

### üéØ Test 6: Dataset Removal and Access Revocation

**Objective**: Test that removing a dataset properly revokes access.

**Steps**:
1. In the project details, find your test dataset
2. Click "Remove" to unassign it from the project
3. Verify the dataset is no longer listed in "Currently Assigned Datasets"
4. Go to "Actions" ‚Üí "Manage Datasets" to see all organization datasets
5. The dataset should still exist but not be assigned to the project

**Expected Result**:
- Dataset successfully removed from project
- Data access through that dataset is revoked
- Dataset still exists in organization but unassigned

---

### üéØ Test 7: Cross-Organization Security

**Objective**: Verify that different organizations cannot access each other's data.

**Steps**:
1. Log out from enterprise.user@enterprisemedia.com
2. Log in with a different organization account (if available)
3. Navigate to Cloud Projects
4. Verify you cannot see:
   - "Corporate Video - Incredible Cotton Shirt" project
   - Datasets from the enterprise organization
   - Any data from the other organization

**Expected Result**:
- Complete isolation between organizations
- No cross-organization data visibility
- Proper multi-tenant security
