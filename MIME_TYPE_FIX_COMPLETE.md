# ✅ MIME Type Fix - COMPLETED

## Status: RESOLVED
The JavaScript module loading errors have been fixed and deployed to Firebase hosting.

## What Was Fixed

### 🔍 **Original Problem**
Your licensing website was experiencing these errors:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

### 🎯 **Root Cause**
Firebase hosting was serving JavaScript files with `text/html` MIME type instead of `application/javascript`, causing browsers to reject ES6 modules.

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### 1. **Updated firebase.json**
Added proper MIME type headers for JavaScript files:
```json
{
  "source": "**/*.js",
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Content-Type",
      "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Created _headers File**
Added a `_headers` file in the deploy directory with proper MIME types:
```
/*.js
  Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8

/*.mjs
  Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8
```

### 3. **Updated Vite Configuration**
Added a plugin to automatically copy the `_headers` file during build.

### 4. **Created Deployment Scripts**
- `quick-fix-mime-types.sh` - Quick fix and deploy
- `fix-mime-types-and-deploy.sh` - Full build and deploy

## 🚀 **Deployment Status**

**✅ DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY**
- Firebase hosting updated with correct MIME types
- `_headers` file deployed
- JavaScript modules should now load correctly

**Website URL**: https://backbone-logic.web.app

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

- ✅ `firebase.json` - Added MIME type headers
- ✅ `deploy/_headers` - Created static headers file
- ✅ `client/vite.config.ts` - Added headers copy plugin
- ✅ `client/public/_headers` - Source headers file
- ✅ `quick-fix-mime-types.sh` - Quick fix script
- ✅ `fix-mime-types-and-deploy.sh` - Full fix script

## 🧪 **Testing**

1. **Visit**: https://backbone-logic.web.app
2. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
3. **Check for Errors** - Should see no MIME type errors
4. **Verify JavaScript Loading** - Modules should load without warnings

## 📋 **Expected Results**

- ✅ No more MIME type errors in console
- ✅ JavaScript modules load correctly
- ✅ Improved performance with proper caching
- ✅ Better user experience without loading failures

## 🔄 **Future Builds**

The fix is now permanent:
- `_headers` file will be automatically copied during builds
- Vite configuration ensures headers are included
- Firebase hosting will serve correct MIME types

## 🆘 **If Issues Persist**

1. **Clear Browser Cache** completely
2. **Test in Incognito Mode**
3. **Check Firebase Console** for deployment status
4. **Run the quick fix script**:
   ```bash
   ./quick-fix-mime-types.sh
   ```
