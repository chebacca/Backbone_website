# MIME Type Fix Summary for Licensing Website

## Problem Description
The licensing website was experiencing JavaScript module loading errors due to incorrect MIME types:

```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

## Root Cause
Firebase hosting was serving JavaScript files with `text/html` MIME type instead of `application/javascript`, causing browsers to reject ES modules.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Updated firebase.json
Added proper MIME type headers for JavaScript files:

```json
{
  "source": "**/*.js",
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Content-Type",
      "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Created _headers File
Added a `_headers` file in the deploy directory as a fallback method:

```
/*.js
  Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8

/*.mjs
  Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8
```

### 3. Created Deployment Script
Created `fix-mime-types-and-deploy.sh` to automate the fix and deployment process.

## Files Modified
- `firebase.json` - Added proper MIME type headers
- `deploy/_headers` - Created static headers file
- `fix-mime-types-and-deploy.sh` - Created deployment script

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script
```bash
cd "dashboard-v14-licensing-website 2"
./fix-mime-types-and-deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
cd "dashboard-v14-licensing-website 2"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Expected Results
After deployment:
- ✅ JavaScript modules will load correctly
- ✅ No more MIME type errors in console
- ✅ Proper caching headers for static assets
- ✅ Improved performance due to correct caching

## Verification
1. Deploy the changes
2. Clear browser cache
3. Reload the website
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify JavaScript modules load without MIME type warnings

## Additional Notes
- The fix ensures both `.js` and `.mjs` files are served with correct MIME types
- Cache headers are optimized for static assets
- The solution works with Firebase hosting's header system
- Fallback `_headers` file provides additional compatibility

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Verify the deployment was successful
2. Check Firebase hosting logs
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Test in incognito/private mode
5. Verify the `_headers` file is deployed correctly
