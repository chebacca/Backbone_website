# Team Member Authentication Fix

## Overview

This document outlines the solution implemented to fix the issue where the login page wasn't fetching licenses and returning valid users for Team Member authentication from Firestore.

## Problem Description

The original authentication system had the following issues:

1. **Missing Team Member Support**: The `/auth/login` route only handled regular user authentication
2. **No License Fetching**: Team members couldn't access their project licenses and access information
3. **Incomplete Integration**: Team member authentication methods existed but weren't connected to the main login flow
4. **Missing Firestore Methods**: The Firestore service lacked methods to retrieve team member data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Route

Modified `server/src/routes/auth.ts` to support team member authentication:

```typescript
router.post('/login', [
  body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
  body('password').notEmpty(),
], asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> => {
  // First try to find a regular user
  let user = await firestoreService.getUserByEmail(email);
  
  // If no regular user found, check if this is a team member
  if (!user) {
    const teamMember = await firestoreService.getTeamMemberByEmail(email);
    if (teamMember) {
      // Create user object from team member data
      user = {
        id: teamMember.id,
        email: teamMember.email,
        name: teamMember.name,
        role: 'TEAM_MEMBER',
        isTeamMember: true,
        organizationId: teamMember.organizationId,
        licenseType: teamMember.licenseType,
        status: teamMember.status
      };
    }
  }
  
  // ... authentication logic ...
  
  // For team members, get their project access and licenses
  if (user.isTeamMember) {
    const projectAccess = await firestoreService.getTeamMemberProjectAccess(user.id);
    const licenses = await firestoreService.getTeamMemberLicenses(user.id);
    
    teamMemberData = {
      projectAccess,
      licenses,
      organizationId: user.organizationId,
      licenseType: user.licenseType,
      status: user.status
    };
  }
  
  // Return enhanced response with team member data
  res.json({
    success: true,
    data: {
      user: { /* user data with isTeamMember flag */ },
      tokens,
      teamMemberData // Includes project access and licenses
    }
  });
}));
```

### 2. Enhanced Firestore Service

Added new methods to `server/src/services/firestoreService.ts`:

#### `getTeamMemberByEmail(email: string)`
- Searches both `team_members` and `users` collections
- Identifies team members by role, `isTeamMember` flag, or `licenseType`

#### `getTeamMemberById(id: string)`
- Retrieves team member data by ID
- Supports both collection types

#### `updateTeamMember(id: string, updates: any)`
- Updates team member records
- Handles both collection types

#### `getTeamMemberProjectAccess(teamMemberId: string)`
- Retrieves all projects the team member has access to
- Includes project details, roles, and access levels

#### `getTeamMemberLicenses(teamMemberId: string)`
- Fetches licenses associated with the team member
- Supports both individual and organization-level licenses

### 3. Enhanced Response Structure

The login response now includes:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "User Name",
      "role": "TEAM_MEMBER",
      "isTeamMember": true,
      "organizationId": "org_id",
      "licenseType": "ENTERPRISE",
      "status": "ACTIVE"
    },
    "tokens": {
      "accessToken": "jwt_token",
      "refreshToken": "refresh_token"
    },
    "teamMemberData": {
      "projectAccess": [
        {
          "projectId": "proj_id",
          "projectName": "Project Name",
          "role": "MEMBER",
          "accessLevel": "read",
          "project": { /* project details */ }
        }
      ],
      "licenses": [
        {
          "id": "license_id",
          "type": "ENTERPRISE",
          "status": "ACTIVE",
          "isOrganizationLicense": true
        }
      ],
      "organizationId": "org_id",
      "licenseType": "ENTERPRISE",
      "status": "ACTIVE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### 1. Team Member Login

Team members can now log in using their email and password:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "enterprise.user@example.com",
    "password": "ChangeMe123!"
  }'
```

### 2. Testing the Fix

Use the provided test script:

```bash
cd "dashboard-v14-licensing-website 2"
./scripts/test-team-member-auth.sh
```

### 3. Frontend Integration

The frontend can now:

1. **Detect Team Members**: Check `user.isTeamMember` flag
2. **Access Project Data**: Use `teamMemberData.projectAccess`
3. **Check Licenses**: Access `teamMemberData.licenses`
4. **Handle Organization Context**: Use `user.organizationId`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV=development`: Enables development mode features
- `ALLOW_TEAM_MEMBER_DEV_LOGIN=true`: Allows any password for team members in development

### Firestore Collections

The system expects these collections:

- `users`: Regular user accounts
- `team_members`: Team member records
- `project_team_members`: Project assignments
- `projects`: Project information
- `licenses`: License records
- `organizations`: Organization data

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Validation**: Team members with `hashedPassword` have their passwords validated
2. **Development Mode**: In development, any password is accepted for team members without hashed passwords
3. **Audit Logging**: All login attempts are logged with team member identification
4. **Role-Based Access**: Team members receive `TEAM_MEMBER` role for proper authorization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid credentials" error**
   - Check if team member exists in Firestore
   - Verify email format and case sensitivity
   - Ensure team member has proper role flags

2. **Missing team member data**
   - Check Firestore collection structure
   - Verify team member has project assignments
   - Check for organization-level licenses

3. **Authentication tokens not generated**
   - Verify JWT configuration
   - Check for validation errors in the request

### Debug Steps

1. Check service logs for authentication attempts
2. Verify Firestore data structure
3. Test with the provided test script
4. Check network requests in browser developer tools

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Password Security**: Implement proper password hashing for all team members
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA support for team members
3. **Role-Based Permissions**: Implement granular access control
4. **License Validation**: Add real-time license status checking
5. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging for compliance requirements

## Support

For issues or questions regarding this implementation:

1. Check the test script output for detailed error information
2. Review Firestore data structure and permissions
3. Verify environment configuration
4. Check service logs for detailed error messages

## Conclusion

This fix provides a robust foundation for team member authentication, ensuring that:

- Team members can authenticate with their credentials
- Project access and license information is properly retrieved
- The system maintains security while providing necessary access
- The solution is scalable and maintainable

The implementation follows the MPC library best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication system.
